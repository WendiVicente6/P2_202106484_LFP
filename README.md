# Spark Stack
University project of the Formal Languages and Programming course of the fourth semester.
## Description
In order to delve deeper into the subject of context-independent languages, it is requested that
Create a program with a graphical interface using the Python programming language. The program
called "Spark Stack" integrates two functionalities sections, one focused on free grammars of
context and another one that integrates useful functionalities for understanding stack automata.
The flow of the program will work through menus with which the user can navigate between the
different functionalities offered by the modules. Each of the two modules group actions of
very useful for those who want to understand how context-free languages ​​work.
The creation of stack automata, like context-free grammars, will be done through
input files that will allow optimizing the operation of the program. It should be noted that the
input files will have a defined structure and no errors, so they can be read
using Python's own features without the need to implement some kind of parser.
During the qualification, questions will be asked about the way in which each of the
functionalities to verify that the student is the author of the solution.
